# Keen
Keen is a CSS library that I developed, it has a modern, clean and vibrant design aesthetic to inspire developers to build beautiful, flexible user interfaces!

**Check out the demo here: https://ali-row.github.io/Keen/**

Keen is built with SCSS and is compiled into a minified CSS file, Keen will be hosted via a CDN and will also be fully downloadable once it's development is complete.

Development is still ongoing!
